# Expanduino-Arduino
Arduino library that implements Expanduino protocol

You just built yourself a nice Arduino-based peripheral device, and now, you need to communicate with a Linux box?

You can read and write data over the Serial port using your own software (You are probably doing it already).

But if your device is just a bunch of buttons, leds, serial ports, etc, why bother?
There should be a kernel driver to make it work out-of-the box. 

*This is what the expanduino library is there for!*
